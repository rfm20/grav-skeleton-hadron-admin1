===

## What is Hadron?
Hadron is a modern [Grav](https://getgrav.org) theme based on [Quark](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-quark). As a child theme of Quark, it contains extended features compared to the original Quark theme. It also offers advanced design options.

## What is the difference between the Hadron Skeleton & Theme?
Hadron comes in 2 variants: as a theme and as a skeleton. The skeleton includes the theme.

The theme is a modular part of Grav. Similar to plugins, themes can be installed more or less freely. Depending on the theme, there are different types of pages that can be used, as well as other options to edit the behavior of the page.

The skeleton is a larger part of Grav. More precisely, a skeleton contains the entire `/user` folder. This includes pages, configurations, plugins, themes, and possibly also accounts and other data.

Thus, the skeleton can be used as a ready-made template for a website, which can be edited and published directly. The theme, however, requires an existing page.

## Should I use the Skeleton or the Theme?
Depending on the use case, it is better to use the skeleton or the theme.

### Why the Skeleton?
You should use the Hadron skeleton in the following cases:
- you want a ready-made page that you can edit, including pages, configuration & themes/ plugins
- you want to create a page with Grav
- you are looking for an easy way to get started with Grav
- you want to try out Hadron live (demo)

### When the Theme?
In the following cases, it makes more sense to use the theme instead of the skeleton:
- you have already created a page with Grav and are looking for a (different) theme
- you use the Quark theme but want more features
- you do not want to use a standard template but build everything from scratch

## Features of Hadron
The Hadron theme offers the following features:
- German translations
- responsive tables
- navigation with drop-down menu
- featured posts in blogs

### Features adopted from Quark

- Lightweight and minimal for optimal performance

- Fully responsive with full-page mobile navigation
- SCSS based CSS source files for easy customization
- Built-in support for on-page navigation

- Default groups configuration to easily manage user permissions via admin
- Default pages for standard, blog, contact, modular, and other pages
- Default plugins + config to enhance the site for publishing
- Default config for sendgrid email support
- Default config for doppler secrets manager (needs our [custom Grav Core](https://github.com/Crabston/grav))
